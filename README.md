# Rushsteve1's Homebrew Packages

My collection of custom [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) packages.

These should all be mostly stable, but use at your own risk.

Pre-built binary Bottles should be produced for all packages, if you prefer.

Actual development happens on the `dev` branch, in order to keep `main` a bit
more stable.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install rushsteve1/pkgs/<formula>`

Or `brew tap rushsteve1/pkgs` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
